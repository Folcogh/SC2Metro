SC2 Metronome


SC2 Metronome is a tool for improving your mechanics in StarCraft(R) II, by playing the sound you choose at a constant period. Thus it can help you to get constant worker production, optimal creep expansion, perfect injections, or remind you about minimap, scouting or supply blocks.

This program has been written by Martial Demolins AKA Folco. See the License text for full licenses informations.

For bug report or suggestion, please mail me at <mdemolins at gmail dot com>.

SC2 Metronome doesn't hack the StarCraft(R) II binaries or memory data in any way, so it fully respects the Blizzard Entertainment(R) licenses and copyrights.
